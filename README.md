This project is a C# Windows Forms application created for my CIS 199 course.

I built an interactive program for Smiths Auto Repairs that collects customer and vehicle information and calculates an estimated repair cost. The program uses variables and named constants for the consultation fee, labor rate, and senior discount (no magic numbers).

The total is calculated based on work hours, number of staff assigned, and parts cost, with an optional senior citizen discount applied. The user enters their information into text boxes and clicks a button to generate the final estimate.

This assignment demonstrates my understanding of variables, constants, arithmetic calculations, user input, conditional logic, and event-driven programming in C# Windows Forms.
